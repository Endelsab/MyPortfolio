                        Hello, I&apos;m Wendel Sabayo from the Philippines.
                        Initially, I had no intention of becoming a web
                        developerâ€”I only started learning programming because I
                        failed my computer programming subject. However, as time
                        passed, what began as a necessity turned into a passion.
                        My curiosity grew, and I became deeply engaged in web
                        development. Debugging and solving errors, while
                        sometimes stressful, became an exciting challenge that
                        kept me motivated and eager to learn more.
